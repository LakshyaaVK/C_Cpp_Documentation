//a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable , it also takes up some place in the ram
//int datatype takes 4 bytes in ram
//char datatype takes 1 byte in ram
//float datatype takes 4 bytes in ram
//double datatype takes 8 bytes in ram
//to find range of a datatype occupies in ram we the formula -2^n to 2^n-1 where n is the number of bits memory
//so for int datatype the range will be -2^31 to 2^31
//1 byte = 8 bits



//int *p; // p is a pointer to an integer memory
//p = &a; // p now holds the address of variable a memory
//printf ("%d", p); // prints the address of a
//printf ("%d", &a); // prints address of a
//printf ("%d", &p); // prints the address of p
//printf ("%d", *p); // prints the value of a Called dereferencing a pointer
